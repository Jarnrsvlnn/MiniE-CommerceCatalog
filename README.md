# MiniE-CommerceCatalog
This is my mini e-commerce catalog project built with PHP.
I made it to practice the fundamentals I’ve been learning the past few days, things like arrays, loops, functions, and file inclusion.

It’s not a full e-commerce system yet, but it gives me a way to simulate products, manage them, and calculate some totals.
